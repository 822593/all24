# Python Deployment

This is an experiment to make multi-file python work better
with the Raspberry Pi's, without creating a bunch of complexity.

The key is that python can load modules out of zip files. 

So you zip up the source directory and upload it.

You also have a very short python script that runs the
zip file -- you just upload this one time.
